This is a collection of Qualitative research projects. 

**CARE model:** A behavioral health facility partnered with Cornell University's CARE program to provide higher quality and more effective therapeutic care. 
After their trainers did their part, the CARE program at this facility still struggled with successful implementation. I interviewed front-line employees to learn about the challenges they faced. 
I created a document for executive leadership which highlighted recommended solutions based on employee feedback and my knowledge as a trainer in the program. 

**CEC Recommendations:** The DEI (Cultural Competence) committee which I chaired had voted to improve more culturally effective communicated. 
The company had experienced some drastic leadership changes which caused many challenges, especially in being able to work with the new leaders and each other. 
I directed company-wide qualitative research to determine what goals we should strive for and recommended several actionable ideas. 
I lead the Community Cafe intervention (mentioned in the project) in which the new leaders and staff were invited to have lunch together and discuss several carefully-chosen topics. 
The evaluation from employees reported a perception of 42% improvement in culturally effective communication.   

**Dissertation Results:** My dissertation topic was **The Experience of Meaning in Work for Millennials**. Here is a graphic detailing the qualitative findings. Dissertation is available upon request. 

**INSIGHTS Business Journal Article:** I wrote an article based on my dissertation and provided an executive presentation ti the Think2Perform Research Insitute's board members. 
The article **Creating a Culture of Committed Millennials** was published in their business magazine and can also be found at https://www.t2pri.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E.COKER-ARTICLE.sngl-pgs.pdf

**Employee Intervention:** A mid-size cable company experienced team interaction challenges due to natural employee changes. I interviewed each employee to understand the systemic issues that I could report to executive leadership.
I then created a powerpoint to present to employees to help them see the challenges and changes more clearly, and to offer information about how they can improve their environment for themselves. 


**Skills:** Interviewing, Observation, Pattern-Finding, Knowledge of Qualitative Methodology
