# <ins> Hi, I'm Dr. Eve Coker. </ins>
I entered the field of data analysis due to working in high-stress fields where organizations needed to carefully monitor processes and understand behavior at a systemic level in order to improve operational functioning.\
I hold a PhD in Industrial-Organizational Psychology, which is the study of how people behave in organizations. I'm also a licensed psychotherapist and hold a Masters in Mental Health Counseling.\
I love data analysis because we can use it to help improve organizational functioning for leaders, employees, and the people we serve. \
My research has centered on the intersection of work and mental health, and my clients range from CEOs and business owners to front line workers.\
I utilize Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, SQL, and Python. I know how to create organization-specific assessments as well as to deliver, interpret, analyze, and present from validated instruments. \
