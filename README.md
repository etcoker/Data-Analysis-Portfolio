# <ins> Hi, I'm Dr. Eve Coker. </ins>
I entered the field of data analysis due to working in high-stress fields where organizations needed to carefully monitor processes and understand behavior at a systemic level in order to improve operational functioning.\
I hold a PhD in Industrial-Organizational Psychology, which is the study of how people behave in organizations. I'm also a licensed psychotherapist and hold a Masters in Mental Health Counseling.\
I love data analysis because we can use it to help improve organizational functioning for leaders, employees, and the people we serve. \
My research has centered on the intersection of using data to understand and improve functioning, and my clients range from CEOs and business owners to front line workers.\
I utilize Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, SQL, and Python. I know how to create organization-specific assessments as well as to deliver, interpret, analyze, and present from validated instruments. 

All data analysis projects are listed in the folders above, but some of the noteworthy projects are listed below.

## Employee Attrition Analysis - [Link to Technical Report](/Employee%20Analysis/Attrition%20Analysis%20-%20Technical%20Report.pdf)
[Link to Python Code](/Employee%20Analysis/Attrition%20Analysis%20Python%20Code.pdf)
**Description:** According to HR data, KBK Electronics has hit a 24% attrition rate. A logistic regression was performed to predict the future attrition rates among multiple variables.\
Chi-square assessments were performed to find the relationship between attrition and categorical variables, and t-tests were performed for the relationship between attrition and continuous variables. \
Using Cramer's V and Cohen's d, the top three most likely causes for the attrition were identified. 

**Tools:** PowerBI, Python

**Skills:** Statistical Assessment, Python Programming, Data Visualization.   

**Outputs:** Technical Presentation.

## Chemcorp Business Analysis - [Link to project on the Tableau Public site](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eve.coker/viz/Chemcorpproject_17393777176150/Story1?publish=yes) 

**Description:** A case study was performed for a chemical manufacturer which was threatened by startups with new technologies. The goal was to prevent the loss of future market share through the identification of future growth industries and identification of at least one divestment product in at least one of the chemical industries. 

**Tools:** Tableau.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Assessment Interpretation, Data Visualization.  

**Outputs:** Executive Presentation, Interactive Dashboards.

## Agency-Wide Scorecards - [Link to Page](/Agency-Wide%20Scorecards)

**Description:** For Thompson CFF, I overhauled the data reporting system for more at-a-glance storytelling. The data collection was revamped to be minimally disruptive to program functioning. Data analysis was streamlined. \
The scorecards were created to show business analysis, including KPIS and financial markers, as well as outcomes pertinent to funding, operational decisions, and accreditation. \
Agency-wide scorecards were shown to executive leadership on a monthly basis. Program or Line Of Business scorecards were shown to relevant stakeholders. Further micro views were provided to specific employees or managers for daily decision-making.\
This project was comprehensive: I developed the data collection devices, trained managers to train staff for how to enter information, gathered and analyzed the data, and then showed it via the scorecards and other pertinent communications. 

**Tools:** SurveyMonkey Enterprise, Excel

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Assessment Interpretation, Excel Formulas, PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, Named Ranges, Data Validation, Data Visualization.  

**Outputs:** Agency-Wide Dashboards, Program-Specific Dashboards, Metric-Specific Dashboards, Employee-Specific Dashboards, and Client-Specific Dashboards.
