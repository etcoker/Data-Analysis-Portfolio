Behavioral Health organizations have to report to governing bodies when staff are forced to restrain patients if they act like they'll harm themselves or others. Too many restraints can put the organization in jeapardy when it comes to licensing and financial assistance. 

I've built these tracking tools for several facilities to help management understand the root of challenging behaviors. The pivot tables and slicers are used to get a clearer picture of when and how the patient's behavioral challenges arise.  

For example, managers have seen that behaviors might arise before and after everyone is escorted to lunch; or they might see that a certain patient has too many escalating responses to a certain tone of voice. 
These tools have allowed managers to make programmatic changes both logicistically and in terms of staff training.
