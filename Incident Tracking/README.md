# <ins> Incident Tracking </ins>
**Description:** Behavioral Health organizations have to report to governing bodies when staff are forced to restrain patients if they act like they'll harm themselves or others. Too many restraints can put the organization in jeopardy when it comes to licensing and financial assistance. \
I've built these tracking tools for several facilities to help management understand the root of challenging behaviors. The pivot tables and slicers are used to get a clearer picture of when and how the patient's behavioral challenges arise.  These tools have allowed managers to make programmatic changes both logistically and in terms of staff training/
They could also be built for any environment that needs to track incidents for the purpose of reducing and eliminating them. 

**Tools:** Excel.

**Skills:** Data Analysis, Excel Formulas, PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, Named Ranges, Data Validation, Data Visualization, Slicers.  

**Outputs:** Interactive dashboards which allow users to view macro and micro views of multiple variables.
