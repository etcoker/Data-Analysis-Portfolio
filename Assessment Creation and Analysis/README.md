For multiple agencies I've used validated assessments to track individual experience, but I've also created bespoke assessments and surveys based on the goals and values of the organization. 

Here is an example of anonymous PHQ-9 (depression), PHQ15 (somatic), GAD (anxiety) and DASS (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress) results. 

The other questionnaires are included as an example of sheets I've created (Exit Survey and OARS worksheet) or have frequently worked with (ACE and SDQ).
