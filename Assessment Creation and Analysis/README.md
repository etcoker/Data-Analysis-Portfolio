# <ins> Assessment Creation and Analysis </ins>
**Description:** For multiple agencies I've used validated assessments to track individual experience, but I've also created bespoke assessments and surveys based on the goals and values of the organization. \
Here is an example of anonymous PHQ-9 (depression), PHQ15 (somatic), GAD (anxiety) and DASS (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress) results. \
The other questionnaires are included as an example of sheets I've created (Exit Survey and OARS worksheet) or have frequently worked with (ACE and SDQ). 

**Tools:** Excel, Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system, Validated Assessments.

**Skills:** Data Analysis, Assessment Interpretation, Excel Formulas, PivotTables, EMR knowledge. 

**Outputs:** Data that either gives us a one-glance understanding of the individual's experience, or something that shows us change over time.

The assessment-taker is always a valuable source of ensuring accuracy and reliability.
