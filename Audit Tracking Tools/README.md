Many organizations I've worked with had strict governing body standards. On a regular basis, they had to prove that they were adhering to those standards. It was often difficult for them to keep track of what was acceptable and what needed more work. 

I've created different tracking sheets to capture different governing body's standards, depending on the organization. 

These tracking sheets were created to ensure that nothing was overlooked. As the tracking sheet is filled out, the numbers would turn red or green to help draw attention to problem areas. 

The main "Totals" pages were also color-coded and would reflect the averaged numbers indicating compliance. 

All numbers have been erased or changed to protect privacy.
