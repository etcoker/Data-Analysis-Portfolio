# <ins> Scorecards </ins>

**Description:** For Thompson CFF, I overhauled the data reporting system for more at-a-glance storytelling. The data collection was revamped to be minimally disruptive to program functioning. Data analysis was streamlined. \
The scorecards were created to show business analysis, including KPIS and financial markers, as well as outcomes pertinent to funding, operational decisions, and accreditation. \
Agency-wide scorecards were shown to executive leadership on a monthly basis. Program or Line Of Business scorecards were shown to relevant stakeholders. Further micro views were provided to specific employees or managers for daily decision-making. 

**Tools:** SurveyMonkey Enterprise, Excel

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Assessment Interpretation, Excel Formulas, PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, Named Ranges, Data Validation, Data Visualization.  

**Outputs:** Agency-Wide Dashboards, Program-Specific Dashboards, Metric-Specific Dashboards, Employee-Specific Dashboards, and Client-Specific Dashboards.
